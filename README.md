# Elevator Counter!


This is an  **Elevator Counter** program that willl calcaulate and return the remianing steps needed to get to your desired floor when you get on an elevator. 
You simply enter your entry floor number and your destination target also. 
The program calculates which way you are heading and counts down the floors as you initate movement up until arrival  

This is a simple python script illustrating the use of conditionals and loops as well as playing with string literals >

Feel free to play with it and hit me back.

I will be modifying this as I continue to progress in my learning.
Cheers evryone
